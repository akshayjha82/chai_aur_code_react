1) Basic_react fundamentals

    React is a library of javascript. React is single page application. All the components made are added inside div#root inside index.html file.All the various components are made by creating a function that returns html and that component is rendered inside the index.js file via the reactdom(A virtual dom created by react. It is used for comaparison with the browsers dom .React makes changes in the browsers dom by comparing it to it's own virtual dom). We can see that in index.html file the index.js file is not inject or rather there is no script tag at all .Then the question arises how can we render the div element of html file in index.js file ,it is possible becoz of react-script dependency which is provided by react libray this automatically injects the js file inside the html file .React also provides many testing dependencies. 

    Rules while creating a component in react:
    1) The component should be a function or a class.
    2)If the component retuns a html then we use .jsx and if not returning an html then just .js for the file in which we create the component
    3)The function or class name should be capital or it won't return the html code .
    4)The component should be exported so that it can be imported in other files.
    5)For using the component we have to import it in the file where we are using that component 

2)Vite

    vite is a library of js just like react but is less weighted then react.it has it's own rules for writing the code.For example in react the react-scripts are responsible for adding the js file in html but here it internally adds the js file in html like standard html application. It also does'nt has testing dependency like react that's why it is less weighted tha react .In vite the node_modules folder has to be intalled externally using npm i command

    Rules while creating a component in react:
    1) The component should be a function or a class.
    2)We use .jsx compulsarily for the file in which we create the component
    3)The function or class name should be capital or it won't return the html code .
    4)The component should be exported so that it can be imported in other files.
    5)For using the component we have to import it in the file where we are using that component 

Some important note :
gitignore file tells us what to actually push in git
package.json tells us about all the dependency that the react or vite has 
node_modules has all the dependency
every component is made inside src folder 
public folder is the one in which the main html file is 
We use router to route to some other page in a website

If we use react in browser then we react dom of react is used for the job while if we wnt to implement the mobile app then we use react native .
